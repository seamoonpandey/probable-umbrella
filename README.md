# DISCUSSION on Problems

## Contains Duplicate

### Problem Statement

The "Contains Duplicate" problem involves determining if a given list of integers contains any duplicate elements. Multiple solutions are available for this problem, each with its own trade-offs in terms of time and space complexity.

### Brute-Force Solution

One way to address the "Contains Duplicate" problem is to use a brute-force algorithm. This approach involves comparing every pair of elements in the list and has the following characteristics:

- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2) - It involves nested loops for element comparisons.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - No additional data structures are used.

### Sorting Solution

Another approach is to sort the array first and then compare corresponding indexes. This method offers better time complexity at the expense of space complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** O(nlogn) - Due to the sorting step.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - Minimal extra memory is used.

### Hash Table Solution

The third approach is to use a hash table, which sacrifices some space complexity for improved time complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) - Hash table lookup.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) - Additional memory used for the hash table.
